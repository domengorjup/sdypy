Abstract
--------
A three level scale of integration of a package into SDyPy is proposed to enable
the connectivity of the exisiting projects. The levels differ in consistency of
nomenclature with SDyPy, developed documentation and testing. The levels 
of integration enable quick association of a project with SDyPy, without
extened efforts from the developers. Higher levels of integration can be achieved
by developing the project in agreement with SDyPy guidelines.

Motivation
----------
The SDyPy project was created to unify the efforst in structural dynamics and 
associate the relevant projects; however, the existing packages were developed 
independantly, with various degrees of compatibility. To minimize the efforts
of the developers, the three levels of integration are proposed, enabeling
the developers to choose the level of the desired independancy of their project
and level of integration into SDyPy.

Detailed description
--------------------
The three levels of integration:

- **1st level**:
   - External package, imported into SDyPy namespace
   - All of the SDyPy modules

- **2nd level**:
   - External packages, dependencies of SDyPy

- **3rd level**:
   - External packages, listed as related projects

3rd level
^^^^^^^^^
The projects that are associated with structural dynamics and noise research are
automatically a 3rd level project. The project does not necessarily have the
documentation, testing or a common nomenclature.

2nd level
^^^^^^^^^
The 3rd level project can become a 2nd level project if the following criteria are
met:

- Well written docstrings
- SDyPy's docstring format
- Sufficient documentation
- Code testing
- Possible PyPI installation (wheel)

1st level
^^^^^^^^^
To advance to 1st level, the project must also use a common
nomenclature, used in SDyPy. This ensures interoperability of the SDyPy.

The 1st level pacakges can be further developed separately or are fully integrated
into SDyPy as a module.
