Abstract
--------
A three level scale of integration of a package into SDyPy is proposed to enable
the connectivity of the existing projects. The levels differ in consistency of
nomenclature with SDyPy, developed documentation and testing. The levels 
of integration enable quick association of a project with SDyPy, without
extended efforts from the developers. Higher levels of integration can be achieved
by developing the project in agreement with SDyPy guidelines.

Motivation
----------
The SDyPy project was created to unify the effort in structural dynamics and 
associate the relevant projects; however, the existing packages were developed 
independently, with various degrees of compatibility. To minimize the efforts
of the developers, the three levels of integration are proposed, enabling
the developers to choose the level of the desired independency of their project
and level of integration into SDyPy.

Detailed description
--------------------
The three levels of integration:

- **1st level**:
   - This packages are imported into SDyPy namespace, 
   - Packages are still developed in a separate repository (preferably under the SDyPy organization)
   - Tests of interoperability to other 1st level packages, 
   - Corresponds to nomenclature guidelines of SDyPy,
   - Testing and documentation corresponds to the SDyPy template,
   - Package has an MIT or similar licence which enables free use of any purpose (incl. commercial).
   
- **2nd level**:
   - Testing and documentation corresponds to the SDyPy template,
   - Package has an MIT or similar licence which enables free use of any purpose (incl. commercial).
   - Preferable PIP supported installation (wheels)

- **3rd level**:
   - External packages, listed as related projects
