Abstract
--------

This roadmap should be clear about what should be the core 
capabilities of the SDyPy (namespace) packages. This roadmap should also serve as a radar of packages which 
could be integrated (if this is suggested by the autors) into SDyPy.

Motivation and Scope
--------------------

SDyPy is supporting individual user(s) driven packages. However, for long-term stability of the effort it is
better that the development and governance is transfered to an independent, multi-institution based 
organisation with an open and transparent governance.
SDyPy organisation was established to provide this long-term stability. If individual packages are based 
on the SDyPy project template then they can easily transition from level 4 or 3 to level 2 or 1 namespace 
packages. The integration to the SDyPy package/organisation is made if:
   * the authors propose such integration and
   * the functionalities of the package extend the capabilities of the sdypy package as written in this SEP.

The transition to SDyPy should preserve as much of development history as possible (git).

Detailed description
--------------------

The long-term functionalities the sdypy package should have are:

* ``sdypy.es``: Excitation signal generation
   * short term goal transition from ``pyExSi``
   * currently prefered package: ``pyExSi``

* ``sdypy.FRF``: Frequency Response Function computation
   * short/long term goal is to developp a new package (based on pyFRF or any other package) 
     with MIMO, windowing, units, delay handling, etc.
   * currently prefered package: ``pyFRF``

* ``sdypy.EMA``: Experimental Modal Analysis
   * implemented as ``sdypy.EMA``

* ``sdypy.OMA``: Operational Modal Analysis
   * probably OMA will be integrated under EMA with specific parameters.

* ``sdypy.rd``: Random Data Analysis
   *
