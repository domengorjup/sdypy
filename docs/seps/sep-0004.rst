Abstract
--------

The purpose of the SDyPy package is to defragment and combine the effort in the
field of structural dynamics in general; however, some main functionalities must
be a priority in the SDyPy development. The priority areas are proposed here.

Motivation and Scope
--------------------

While the goal of the SDyPy package is to provide a wide array of useful functionality
in the field of structural dynamics, implementation of particular functionalities should
be prioritized as they can be considered the central parts of the field.

In this SEP, the priority areas of structural dynamics are proposed. Other functionalities
can also be included but are not prioritized.


Detailed description
--------------------

The development effort should be primarily directed towards implementation of the 
following areas in the field of structural dynamics:

* Excitation signal generation
   * currently ``pyExSi``

* Frequency Response Function computation
   * currently ``pyFRF``

* Experimental Modal Analysis
   * implemented as ``sdypy.EMA``

* Operational Modal Analysis
