SDyPy - Structural Dynamics Python
----------------------------------

This package has the goal to defragment the open source effort in the scientific field 
of structural dynamics. Our goal is to speed-up the development and implementation of scientific
methods. This an open and free initiative, we stand up for:

 - free MIT license,
 - open development,
 - open accepting of contributions,
 - open decision making,
 - multi-institutional engagement.

 SDyPy depends on core SciPy stack packages, please use those packages where posible. If you 
 would like an extension to be implemented, if it is general and not related to structural dynamics.
 consider implementing it into the SciPy stack.


Installation
------------

Install this package by:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install sdypy
